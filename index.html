        <p>5S is a workplace organization methodology that originated in Japan. It stands for five Japanese words:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Seiton (Set in Order) - Arrange necessary items in a designated place for easy access.</li>
            <li>Seiso (Shine) - Keep the workplace clean and organized.</li>
            <li>Seiketsu (Standardize) - Maintain a consistent practice of the first 3 Ss.</li>
            <li>Shitsuke (Sustain) - Foster a culture of continuous improvement.</li>
        </ul>
